# Clox - Implementation following [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com)

NOTE: I'm using chapter numbers relative to the start of clox, not jlox. Chapter 1 is ["Chunks of Bytecode"](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/chunks-of-bytecode.html), which is Chapter 14. I also stopped using chapter numbers and just started labeling based on the chapter title.
